My First test site for Odin

This is meant to be the first "complete" site I build through the Odin Project. 

It is meant to display competence in 
- formatting a basic HTML page
- Using text-formatting tags
- Using Lists
- Using Links and Images
- Doing it all in a proper fashion with all the accompanying commit messages etc.

Although I was already familiar with those basic HTML commands, it's been a while and this is a good refresher and a stepping stone towards harder projects.
